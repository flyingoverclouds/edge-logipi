## running
The real logi_loader use the RPi3 I2C bus to detect LogiPi board, and SPI bus to upload Xilinx bitstream in the FPGA.

This two buses must be accessible from the container :

	docker run --device /dev/i2c-1 --device /dev/spidev0.1 -it MyBitstreamContainerImage


An other way to run logi_loader in a container, is launching the container with 'privilege'.  
For testing, it's fine ... but it's preferable to reduce the surface attack/risk at its minimal level.

	docker run --privileged -it logi_loader_rpi3
